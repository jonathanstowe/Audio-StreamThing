# Audio::StreamThing

A very rudimentary and experimental audio streaming server.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanstowe/Audio-StreamThing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanstowe/Audio-StreamThing)

## Synopsis

```perl6
use Audio::StreamThing;

my $server = Audio::StreamThing.new(port => 8898);

$server.run;
```

## Description

I started making this as I wanted a simple
[Icecast](http://icecast.org/) compatible server to test
[Audio::Libshout](https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Audio-Libshout) but
when I realised that it could actually handle more than one client at
once I thought I'd make it into a proper server :)

I wrote [an article](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/day-13-audio-streaming-done-completely-wrong/)
about the way I came to make this.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working Rakudo Perl 6 installation you can install this
with *zef* :

     zef install Audio::StreamThing

     # Or from a local checkout

     zef install .

## Support

This should be considered highly experimental and is subject to sudden
incompatible changes without warning.

Please send any bug reports, patches and suggestions via
