# Audio::StreamThing

A very rudimentary and experimental audio streaming server.

## Synopsis

```
use Audio::StreamThing;

my $server = Audio::StreamThing.new(port => 8898);

$server.run;
```

## Description

I started making this as I wanted a simple
[Icecast](http://icecast.org/) compatible server to test
[Audio::Libshout](https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Audio-Libshout) but
when I realised that it could actually handle more than one client at
once I thought I'd make it into a proper server :)

## Installation



## Support

This should be considered highly experimental and is subject to sudden
incompatible changes without warning.
